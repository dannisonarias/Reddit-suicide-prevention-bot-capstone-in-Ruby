# Object oriented design with Ruby : Suicide Prevention Reddit Ruby Bot
   What problems does this program solve?
   1.Quickly search reddit for a large list of keywords not normally possible through the website
   2.There's a list of words we'll search for that have been associated with people who have suicidal thoughts
   With this program we can quickly find posts in reddit from the last hour of distressed people
   The intention is to help those suffering from depression. 
   In future updates i want to add the functionality of being able to reply to those posts directly
   with custom or pre-written up-lifting comments.


# GUIDE FOR Suicide prevention: supporting someone online

  Ask if they want to talk to you , encourage them to chat privately
  They may not be ready to open up, but knowing you are willing to listen is a big help. If they don’t want to talk to you, ask them about the support networks they currently have (friends, family, kaumātua, religious, community or cultural leaders, or professionals) and encourage them to seek out someone they trust from those networks.
  
  If they don’t know who they can talk to, suggest a Helpline they could call, or suggest they go and visit their doctor to find professional support.
  
  Remember you don’t have all the answers
  If they do want to chat, do your best to be there for them and listen, but realise that you don’t need to have all the answers. Be gentle, compassionate, and non-judgemental. Take them seriously, and let them know you care."
