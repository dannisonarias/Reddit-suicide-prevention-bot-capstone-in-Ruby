The occasional enjambment and inconsistent pattern of capitalizing the first words in some line is not particularly favorable to me, but isn't a very great annoyance.  The line \" decisions not made are still ones I can keep \" is one of my favorites, because it demonstrates our common helplessness to life, and our reluctance to make certain decisions now because they may negatively affect us in the future.  Overall, your intellectual, yet down-to-earth questioning is very interesting and eye-opening.  Write on", :subreddit_name=>"r/OCPoetry"}]
